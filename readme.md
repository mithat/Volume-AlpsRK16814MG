Volume-AlpsRK16814MG
====================

Alps RK16814MG motorized potentiometer with H-bridge motor drive.

Description
----------
[KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org) design files for a PCB that integrates an 
Alps RK16814MG motorized potentiometer and an H bridge to drive the motor.

The H-bridge is powered from 5VDC. This supply is shared both by the logic and
the motor drive. The ground to this supply is isolated from other grounds.

It is assumed the case of the potentiometer is grounded through the chassis. A
ground pin is provided if this is not the case.
